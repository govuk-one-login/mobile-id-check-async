## `deploy_backend.sh`

### What it does

This script provides the ability to deploy a `backend-api` stack in the AWS dev account.

### How to use it

#### Execute `deploy-backend-to-dev` script

```bash
# From /backend-api
npm run deploy-backend-to-dev <your-stack-name>
```

The deployed stacks will be named as follows:
